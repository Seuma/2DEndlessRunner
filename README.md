# 2DEndlessRunner
A simple 2D Endless runner at first which will run into a story driven game. With that written: The story isn't done yet! Please  be patient

## Purpose of this Project
This project exist just for learning the Godot engine. Nothing more nothing less.
I want to use it as my main engine for future games so I need to know how things
are done there. 

## OMG it looks so ugly!!!
I know it isn't meant to look good since this is the first game I ever made
(yes it is the first game I actually work on with success). It is a project to
go through the steps from the idea to the publishing of it.

## Mechanics / Gameplay
The gameplay itslef is very easy. Use the Arrow keys to move the character.
The up arrow will let the character jump.

## Score
The score is calculated with the traveled distance. It will update save data
after you fell down a gap or because the deletion of the world got you.

### HAVE FUN PLAYING
